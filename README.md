# svelte-ui-kit
*NOTE: This is an experimental project for my own fun and learning purposes only.*  

This is a multi-package monorepo structure managed by [lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) containing a [svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs) based ui kit which appearance is powered by [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).
